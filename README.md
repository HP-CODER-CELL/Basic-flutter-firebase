This Flutter code snippet demonstrates how to implement phone number verification using Firebase Authentication. It calls `verifyPhoneNumber` with the user's phone number, triggering an SMS verification process. The `verificationCompleted` callback handles automatic code retrieval by signing in the user if the credential is auto-resolved. The `verificationFailed` callback logs errors such as invalid numbers or quota issues. The `codeSent` callback provides a `verificationId` used later to sign in with the user-entered SMS code, while `codeAutoRetrievalTimeout` handles timeouts for auto-retrieval. This flow enables secure, user-friendly phone authentication in a Flutter app.
